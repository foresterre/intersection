## Introduction

A crate to find the intersection between a collection of sets. Convenient when your
collection of sets consists of more than 2 sets.

There are two options:
* With `HashSet`, use [hash_set::intersection]().
* With `BTreeSet`, use [btree_set::intersection]().

**Why use this over `HashSet::intersection` or `BTreeSet::intersection`?**

The standard library intersection methods require a bit of ceremony when you want to intersect 3
or more sets with each other. These `intersection(other: &Set)` methods produce a lazy iterator,
which you then have to wrap into a `HashSet::from_iter` again. An alternative way is to use
the `BitAnd` implementation of either set. In both cases it requires a bit of boilerplate
which this library does for you ðŸ˜„. Under the hood, this library uses `BitAnd` to produce an intersected
set of the given input sets.
